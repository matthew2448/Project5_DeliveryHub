## Campus Eats Model

During these unprecedented times, the campus desires to control nonessential traffic and add an extra layer of security for students, faculty. Therefore, the campus has implemented an on-campus delivery service for users to order food from off-campus restaurants. At this time, only eight delivery drivers are allowed to deliver food to select locations only. If successful, the service will continue to operate even after things return to normal on campus. 

## Description

This project will take an existing database prototype provided by the “Mavericks” and expand it into a fully functional database. The database will allow users to place orders one at a time from pre-approved off-campus restaurants. The database will enable the driver to deliver the food to the user at an approved campus location. The addition of a rating system will allow users to rate their entire experience, including the restaurant and driver. These ratings will then upload to the database, allowing other users to view them. This part of the system may also serve as feedback for both restaurants and drivers, allowing them to make any necessary changes to improve their customer relations and secure future business. It will also provide both nutritional and eating habits for those using the database.
